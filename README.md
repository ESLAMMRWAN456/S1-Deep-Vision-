# 📊 Time Wasters on Social Media - Data Analysis Project

 Overview
This project aims to analyze the impact of social media usage on time management and productivity. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we will uncover insights into user behavior, identify trends, and assess the correlation between excessive social media usage and its effects on daily activities.

 Objectives
 **Understand Social Media Usage Patterns**: Identify trends in time spent on different platforms.
**Analyze Productivity Loss**: Examine how excessive social media usage affects work, study, and daily tasks.
  **Develop Data Visualizations**: Create insightful dashboards to showcase key findings.
- **Apply Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Ensure high-quality, structured data for analysis.
- **Explore Predictive Modeling**: Predict usage patterns based on demographics and behavioral data.
